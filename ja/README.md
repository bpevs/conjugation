# Japanese Conjugation Tool

Supports Adjectives and Verbs. See `ConjugationType` and `PartOfSpeech` for
supported parts of speech and conjugation targets.

## License Information

Logic is primarily based on
[Baily Snyder's Conjugation Tool](https://github.com/baileysnyder/japanese-conjugation),
with modifications only to make it easier to import and use. Therefore, I am
distributing the `jp` conjugation code with the same license.

This is not necessarily applicable to other conjugation tools within this
repository.
